Building an AngularJS Website Using Routes
======================

This is a simple AngularJS website using routes and partials. I have also included StateService to show how to preserve state across route changes.

This template is perfect for business sites. It consists of several static pages: projects, privacy, and about pages. Each product has its own page. There is also a contact form for communication. That is all that is necessary for any small website. Moreover, it is also a responsive template, thus it looks good on any device.

I hope you liked the demo, so if you’re ready – let’s start making this application. Please prepare a new folder for our project, and then create new folders in this directory:

css – for stylesheet files
images – for image files
js – for JavaScript files (libraries, models, and controllers)
pages – for internal pages
